# HOMEWORK (FINESSING)

We went through the two deals found in Homework/Deals for the previous lessons folder.

Key learning points:

* Finessing is the act of attmepting to win a trick with a card that is not the highest card out there, while the opponents still holds a card that is higher than the card that wins the trick

* In order to finesse we play the cards in an order such that the opponent who holds the higher card that we are worried about, is forced to play a card before we do

* Play from weakness towards strength in order to take a finesse

* Make sure to consider how to maintain the lead in the weak hand in order to repeat the finesse if neccessary. This is especially important when there is a lack of entries to the hand that we want to lead from when finessing.

The first three key learning points here were the same from the previous lesson, so we did some repition on those. The last one was new.

# LESSON (SUIT COMBINATIONS)

We went through Bridge Master beginner difficulty deal number 7.

Key learning points:

* A suit combination is a set of cards divided between two hands

* A solution to a suit combination is the act of playing the cards in an order such that we maximize the likelyhood of us getting a specified amount of tricks.

* A simple suit combination can sometimes be constructed such that the goal is to be 100% sure of winning all the tricks in that suit, such as the example we went through in the example deal.



Duration of lesson: 90 minutes.
