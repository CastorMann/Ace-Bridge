# LESSON (FINESSING)

Today we dove deeper into finessing, trying to solidify the concept and applying it to some deals. We discussed how to know when we should try to finesse, but also when we should avoid finessing.

Key Learning Points:

* We are able to finesse in a suit when we have an honor that is higher than a missing honor, as well as an honor that is lower than the missing honor.

* We can finesse even if we are missing 2 honors, which is called a double finesse, if we for example have the suit AKT to 432.

* We should finesse when we see that we need the extra tricks that we can gain from that suit in order to make our contract

* We should not finesse if it will cost us too many entries, and we can get enough tricks by simply giving up a trick in that suit in order to establish winners in the suit.

* Always consider how many entries we have and how many we need before finessing, since we always need to start from the weak hand when finessing.
