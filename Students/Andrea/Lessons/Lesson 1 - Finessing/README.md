# LESSON (FINESSING)

We went through Bridge Master beginner difficulty deal number 14, 18 and 19.

Key learning points:

* Finessing is the act of attmepting to win a trick with a card that is not the highest card out there, while the opponents still holds a card that is higher than the card that wins the trick

* In order to finesse we play the cards in an order such that the opponent who holds the higher card that we are worried about, is forced to play a card before we do

* Play from weakness towards strength in order to take a finesse
